To calculate the amount of caffeine left in the body after an arbitrary time ($t$), assuming that the half-life of caffeine in the body is 6 hours, you can use the exponential decay formula. 

The half-life of a substance is the time it takes for its concentration to decrease by half. The formula for the remaining amount of a substance after a certain time ($t$) is:

$A(t) = A_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}}$

Where:
- $A(t)$ is the amount of the substance left after time $t$.
- $A_0$ is the initial amount of the substance.
- $T_{1/2}$ is the half-life of the substance.
- $t$ is the elapsed time.

Given:
- The half-life of caffeine, $T_{1/2} = 6$ hours.

Let's denote:
- $A_0$ as the initial amount of caffeine.
- $t$ as the time elapsed in hours.

Then, the formula becomes:

$A(t) = A_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{6}}$

This formula can be used to calculate the remaining caffeine in the body after any given time $t$.

### Example calculation

If the initial amount of caffeine $A_0$ is 200 mg, and you want to find out how much caffeine is left after 9 hours, you would plug the values into the formula:

$A(9) = 200 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{9}{6}}$

So:

$A(9) = 200 \times 0.354 \approx 70.8 \text{ mg}$

After 9 hours, approximately 70.8 mg of caffeine would remain in the body.
