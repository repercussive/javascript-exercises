# `gramsToOunces`

## Scenario

You are working on a recipe website. You are gaining more and more users from the USA, so you want to add a function to the website that will allow users to convert weights between grams and ounces (specifically, [avoirdupois ounces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce#International_avoirdupois_ounce:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,International%20avoirdupois%20ounce,-%5Bedit%5D)).

## Task

Write a function that takes a weight value in grams, and converts it into ounces.

The result should be rounded to 1 decimal place.

```js
gramsToOunces(100) // returns 3.5
```
