# `getWordCount`

##  Scenario

You are writing a program for teachers to assist them in grading students' essays. The teachers wish to verify that the students' essays do not exceed the word count limit. So, you decide to write a function to calculate this.

## Task

Write a function that, given a string, returns the number of words within the string.

```js
getWordCount('one two three four five') // returns 5
```

For this task, you can consider words to be separated by *spaces* only. Other characters, such as hyphens, should be treated like any other character.
